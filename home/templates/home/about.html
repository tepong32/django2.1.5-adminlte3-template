      <p>In the light of the COVID-19 global pandemic outbreak in 2020 <i>(lockdown was in March here in the Philippines)</i>, I decided to try to create a website. <i>(I just tried.)</i> This was because I already had my eye on learning programming using Python a year or two prior and I already am quite knowledgeable of its basics <i>(I was trying to create my own Android app a few months before the pandemic broke out, too. I think I failed at it, tho.)</i> I just decided that since there will be quite a boring time spending days at home doing barely <b>"just anything"</b>: </p>
      <p>scrolling through facebook, watching <i>(pirated)</i> movies & anime series,  I'll try to be as productive as I can be. I also came across this quote saying:</p>

      <p class="quoteText bg-black p-2 text-bold">"If you don't get a skill or improve one during this home
        quarantine period, you never lacked time; YOU LACKED DISCIPLINE." <br>     
      </p>
      <small>(I can't really remember who said that or where I found it but trust me: someone said it. :D)</small>

            Here's the part specifically intended for curious individuals. This contains a summary of the features / descriptions of everything that can be found/noticed here, as well as those I intend to add in the near future. (I only wanted to have this online ASAP. Functionalities are not yet implemented but the site, as a whole, is functional.)
          </p></i></small>
          <p>
            Always wanting to have a website of my own for self-fulfilling reasons, I decided I will create one. By "create", I mean I will be the one to code (almost) everything...from scratch. This is the result of the countless tutorials I watched, trial versions of the project I made, Googling how to solve error results when trying to run the project, countless modifications to specific features I wished to implement, and everything else. <small><i>(If you wish to check out the very simple, oldest versions of this website deployed, click <a class="text-danger" href="https://thehideout.herokuapp.com" target="_blank">this</a> or <a class="text-danger" href="https://thehideout.pythonanywhere.com" target="_blank">this</a>. See Log-in and Register pages. Everything stepped-up from there.)</small></i>
            <br> <br>
            Below are the site's features: 
          </p>
          <!-- we are adding the accordion ID so Bootstrap's collapse plugin detects it -->
          <div id="accordion">
            <div class="card card-success ml-3">
              <div class="card-header">
                <h4 class="card-title w-100">
                  <a class="d-block w-100" data-toggle="collapse" href="#collapseOne">
                    <b>Created with separated Authed and Un-authed views</b>
                  </a>
                </h4>
              </div>
              <!-- add "show" to class to make the content automatically opened -->
              <div id="collapseOne" class="collapse text-sm text-justify" data-parent="#accordion"> 
                <div class="card-body">
                  <p>
                    Perhaps the feature I really worked myself off for was this one. I literally spent days separating what a logged-in user versus an anonymous user can see (and do).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <i>(Note + bragging rights: I was a business course student.)</i> <br>
                    Based on the latest trends in marketing, every successful <i>(online)</i> business today started showing its target market their product's or service's <b><i>"a taste of what it's like".</i></b> </p>
                    Proof? <br>
                    <p>Please log-out of facebook or any other social media account you have and try to search for any account you know.<br>
                    What did you notice? Your account's preview still shows up even if you're not logged-in, right? <br>
                    Prior to this style of marketing, you'll need to <i>"be a part of the community"</i> first to view a member's profile. <br>
                    You can also try browsing any item on any online selling platform you know of and you'll be asked to log in or create and account <b>only</b> when you're actually ordering something. </p>
                    The marketing game's now changed... <br>
                    And I adapted it here. Custom-coded.<br>

                    Since I originally intended this site to be a forum, user accounts created are intended to have to display "distinct user info" (I will not call it <b>"personal info"</b> since they can all be dummy information just for users to have something to display). It'll be up to the users to add personal information should they determine that it will help people reach-out to them when needed.

                    Another reason I stick to the Django framework was because of its built-in security features. <br> <br>
                    <i>(Disclaimer: No ill intent included.)</i> <br>
                    Unlike the usual language/framework that can be used to create static websites, since this site features allowing users other than the admin to be writers/bloggers, as well, we need a better way of protecting unsuspecting victims of online frauds using html/SQL injections. I am convinced that Django's security features are what we need to minimize the risks. Going a little technical mentioning it here, you can <a class="text-danger" href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/ref/csrf/" target="_blank">check this out</a> for more information. The first paragraph will give you a summary of what you need to know.

                    As for most websites today, users can easily create their accounts using third-party providers' account APIs. Here, I tested-out Google and it's working fine. *sigh*

                    As mentioned, this site is already like most websites today. With that being said, should there be a number of (anonymous) users already, people will think that maybe they should only see updates on their homepages / newsfeed from people they know or have a connection to.

                    I'm having doubts about this feature. I do not want bad actors to be able to phish any information of users here so, as long as you know your login credentials, dummy email addresses and profile information will do. Still, for quick user-registration, it may be implemented. It'll just be the user's discretion what type of login to use.
