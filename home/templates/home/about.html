      <p>In the light of the COVID-19 global pandemic outbreak in 2020 <i>(lockdown was in March here in the Philippines)</i>, I decided to try to create a website. <i>(I just tried.)</i> This was because I already had my eye on learning programming using Python a year or two prior and I already am quite knowledgeable of its basics <i>(I was trying to create my own Android app a few months before the pandemic broke out, too. I think I failed at it, tho.)</i> I just decided that since there will be quite a boring time spending days at home doing barely <b>"just anything"</b>: </p>
      <p>scrolling through facebook, watching <i>(pirated)</i> movies & anime series,  I'll try to be as productive as I can be. I also came across this quote saying:</p>

      <p class="text-warning text-bold">"If you don't get a skill or improve one during this home
        quarantine period, you never lacked time; YOU LACKED DISCIPLINE." <br>
        <small>(I can't really remember who said that or where I found it but trust me: someone said it. :D)</small>
      </p>


      <p>Many, many thanks to all my online mentors from Youtube <small><i>(in no particular order)</i></small> for the knowledge they shared
      which enabled me to create this <b>fascinating</b> <i>(what? just kidding!)</i> website template, together with my other project websites!

          ...and to all others <i>(2Many2Mention)</i> whom I owe the ideas collaborated here, as well as to those video creators I watched who shared knowledge of how to use the different tools and platforms I needed to bring this online. <i>(Special mention: <b>StackOverflow</b> guys and gals!)</i>

      With this, I hope to inspire those who want to learn programming, as
      well.
