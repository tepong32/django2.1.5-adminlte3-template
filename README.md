# teppy.rocks webapp
## django2.1.5 + adminlte3
A Django website template using AdminLTE3 &amp; Bootstrap theming

NOTES:
Please check https://github.com/tepong32/default_dj2.1.5_template for notes on how this was created and change the values of JS's for facebook plugins to match your own hrefs (Better yet: https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/)

The "jessa" branch is a personalized, feminine-themed version of this web app with just the "unauthed pages" modified. It is intended to be used as an "admin-only" dynamic website so, I will not merge it to the master branch. I will actually make a separate repo for the finish product of that "jessa" branch (like a personal blog site with no member-signups / a diary site...you name it.)
Will have this readme file updated afterwards. Cheers.

## Thank you.
